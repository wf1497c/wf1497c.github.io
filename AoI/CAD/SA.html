        <h1>Bone Screw for Rotator Cuff Repair</h1>
        <p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size=5> Suture anchors (SAs) have been prevalently used in orthopedic surgery for repair of rotator cuff tears by inserting in lesser or great tuberosity by tendon-to-bone fixation. Mechanical strength in the bone-screw interface was taken as the primary consideration of SAs designs. Beneath the fixation of suture-tendon interface, under successive removal loading, SAs pullout is the most common mechanism in mechanical failure. In these cases, couples of patient-related and design-related factors involved in mechanical fixation strength against pull-out force could aggravate chronic and symptomatic progression of rotator cuff tear. This study focuses on the relevance between anchor removal and design-related factors including structures and materials. </p>

        <h1>Magnesium</h1>
        <p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size=5>Mg-based alloys with high biodegradability decrease the need for second surgical intervention for removal of devices and lead to stable host response. Studies showed Mg-based materials help surrounding bone generation compared to biodegradable polymers, which allow higher endurance for materials degradation. In addition, compared to conventional metallic materials, the mechanical properties of such alloy are more similar to bone tissue, as a result, stress shielding effects can be reduced. 
        <br><br>
        The benefits mentioned above provide potential of Mg-based in bone implant and overcome certain defects of other metallic or polymer materials. The material we used in this project was Mg<font face="TimesNewRoman" size=1>60<font face="TimesNewRoman" size=5>Zn<font face="TimesNewRoman" size=1>35<font face="TimesNewRoman" size=5>Ca<font face="TimesNewRoman" size=1>5<font face="TimesNewRoman" size=5> bulk metallic glass composite(BMGC), developed by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/20/9/2191">Prof. Jang's team</a>, demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and osteogenic effects. The great potential for future surgical implants was shown in the <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro</I> tests.</p>

        <h1>Design</h1>
        <p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size=5>The optimal design was manufactured as prototype for undergoing mechanical testing followed ASTM F543-20 to validate the results. Served as an important index to evaluate product performances, pullout force required to remove SA outside the bone block is the primary consideration of designs. All models were constructed in computer-aided design (CAD) environments.
        <br><br>Four design parameters were used in our SA as fig.5. shown: Lower thread angle (LA), pitch of upper thread (UP), width of suture groove(W), and tapered tail angle (TA). We proposed a four-factors full factorial design method for better understanding in relevance between design-related factors and pullout force under removal loading. Outer radius shrinked from 5mm (OR1) to 4.5mm (OR2) and inner radius approximate to 3mm. The total length of our SA design is 16.5mm according to common commercial products.

        <h1>Finite Element Analysis</h1>
        <p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size=5> Simulated CAD models composed of SA and polyurethane (PU) block corresponding to the configuration in ASTM F-543. Pre-processing of FE model was implemented by ANSYS/LS-Dyna (ANSYS Inc., Canonsburg, PA, USA). 10-nodes tetrahedral mesh was applied to the FE model. To accurately investigate contact area effect, for testing block, fine mesh (0.22mm) were applied to the screw-bone interface and coarse size (0.7-3.5mm) were used in farer region of the test foam. For SA, the same size as contact element were used in the whole part. The variance of the maximum value of von-Mises stress in convergence test between consecutive groups were lesser than 3% with high element quality when the mesh size of suture anchor was smaller than 0.22mm, with 102,000 elements, and PU blocks consist 118,000 elements, respectively. Total elements of test specimen were around 220,000. All peripheral nodes of testing blocks were constrained in all directions and SA nodes are axial direction-free. Contact between screw-block interface was set to be penalty-based surface-to-surface contact, with friction coefficient 0.2.
        <br><br>
        There are two parts in FEA: displacement control and force control. In displacement control, the SA was set as rigid and to move along the longitudinal axis by assigning displacement curve in prescribed motion form. The contact force in screw-block interface, representing pullout strength, was compared to mechanical tests results for validation and the average of all groups was used as loading in force control. 
        <br><br>
        In force control, 600N and 400N removal loading were given in force control simulation to normal and osteoporotic blocks, respectively. Forces are applied on the nodes in SA eyelet which is hung by suture. The von Mises criteria was used to evaluate the performance of SA and give the optimal design.

        <h1>Manufacture</h1>
        <p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size=5> After the optimal design was determined, the final two steps were manufacturing and conducting the mechanical tests. To our surprise, <strong>the former one served as one of the biggest problem in our project.</strong> The initial idea was to process directly on the Magnesium-based BMGC, i.e. CNC process on such material, however, this composite was inappropriate for this procedure. The cutting would severely make it weaker and destruct its morphologies. As a result, we tried to construct the prototype using metallic 3D printing by coating the material onto the surface, whereas, even the screw structure formed successfully, the temperature for melting was too high to remain the ideal grain arrangement.
        <br><br>
        Finally, we developed a "core-shell" structure to fix the manufacturing problem: a composite rod with pure magnesium rod in the center, and coated with Mg-based BMGC on the outer layer. This core-shell structure was tested and showed nice adhesion between the interface, reasonable hardness, and stronger toughness compared to pure magnesium. This procedure improved the production yield of CNC process and the finished products were strong enough to conduct the mechanical tests.

        <h1>Mechanical Test: ASTM F-543</h1>
        <p><font face="TimesNewRoman" size=5> Procedures of mechanical testing are followed by ASTM F543-20, which provides standards specification for test method for metallic medical bone screws, measuring mechanical properties axial tensile force to fail or remove and in torsion of metallic bone screws that are implanted into the test blocks (10 PCF as osteoporosis and 20 PCF as normal in this case). MTS Bionix® tabletop test systems (MTS systems, MN USA) was used to perform tests. Simplified procedures as followed: drill specified size of pilot hole on the center of top surface of testing block, insert the suture anchor until the alignment of its top and block surface, hold the block by the clamp and fix the suture to the loading fixture, and apply tensile load to the test specimen at a rate of 5 mm/min until the screw fails or releases from the test block. Simultaneously, loading versus displacement profile is recorded for comparison.
